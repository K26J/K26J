## About Me

I am an aspiring Data Scientist with a strong academic background in Statistics (M.Sc.) and practical experience in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

I enjoy working with real-world datasets, performing exploratory data analysis, building predictive models, and extracting insights that support data-driven decision-making. My interests include feature engineering, model evaluation, and applying statistical concepts to solve practical problems.

**Key areas I work on:**
- Data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis  
- Supervised and unsupervised machine learning models  
- Statistical analysis and performance evaluation  
- Dashboard creation and insight communication
